Problem statement
We are going to recognize hand gestures from a video sequence. To recognize these gestures from a live video sequence, we first need to take out the hand region alone removing all the unwanted portions in the video sequence. After segmenting the hand region, we then count the fingers shown in the video sequence to instruct a robot based on the finger count. Thus, the entire problem could be solved using 2 simple steps -

Find and segment the hand region from the video sequence.
Count the number of fingers from the segmented hand region in the video sequence.
